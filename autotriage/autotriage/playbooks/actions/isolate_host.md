# Isolate Host (Mock)

## Goal
Contain a suspected compromised endpoint by isolating it from the network.

## Steps
1. Confirm the host name matches the alert context.
2. Use your EDR tooling to isolate the host.
3. Capture triage artifacts (process tree, network connections).
4. Open an incident if additional hosts/users are implicated.
